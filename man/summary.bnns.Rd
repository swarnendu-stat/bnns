\title{Summary of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) Model}
\usage{
\method{summary}{bnns}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{bnns}, representing a fitted Bayesian Neural Network model.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
None. The function prints the summary to the console.
}
\description{
Provides a comprehensive summary of a fitted Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) model, including details about the model call, data, network architecture, posterior distributions, and model fitting information.
}
\details{
The function prints the following information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Call:} The original function call used to fit the model.
\item \strong{Data Summary:} Number of observations and features in the training data.
\item \strong{Network Architecture:} Structure of the BNN including the number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, and activation functions.
\item \strong{Posterior Summary:} Summarized posterior distributions of key parameters (e.g., weights, biases, and noise parameter).
\item \strong{Model Fit Information:} Bayesian sampling details, including the number of iterations, warmup period, thinning, and chains.
\item \strong{Notes:} Remarks and warnings, such as checks for convergence diagnostics.
